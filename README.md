# Data-Science-Projects
Welcome to Catherine's data science projects page!

I am currently a first year graduate student at Columbia University in Business Analytics. I have experience using Python and R to conduct data analysis. In this page, you can find several data science projects that I have worked on.

## Project descriptions:

<li> Movie Revenue analysis in R </li>
**Description**: This is a project analyzing IMDB movie database. We have conducted exploratory analysis and some modeling (Random forest, XGBoosting) to find what drives movie revenue so that we could project insights for stakeholders such as movie production companies and movie theaters to optimize their marketing strategies. 
**Deliverable**: [Poster generated](https://github.com/cwu821/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Poster_MovieRev_Analysis.pdf) using RPosterdown and the original Rmarkdown file
