## Welcome to Catherine's data science projects page!

I am currently a first year graduate student at Columbia University in Business Analytics. I have experience using Python and R to conduct data analysis. In this page, you can find several data science projects that I have worked on.

## Project descriptions:

- Movie Revenue Analysis in R 
  - Description: This is a project analyzing IMDB movie database. We have conducted exploratory analysis and some modeling (Random forest, XGBoosting) to find what drives movie revenue so that we could project insights for stakeholders such as movie production companies and movie theaters to optimize their marketing strategies.
  - Deliverable: [Poster](https://github.com/cwu821/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Poster_MovieRev_Analysis.pdf) using RPosterdown and the original [Rmarkdown file](https://github.com/cwu821/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/R_MovieRev_Analysis.Rmd).


- Hotel Cancelation Analysis in Python
  - Description: This is a project analyzing the [hotel cancelation data](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand) collected from Kaggle. The goal of the project is to predict whether the booking will be canceled. Throughout the process, we have cleaned the dataset, performed exploratory analysis, built visualizations of the variables, applied several models (decision tree, random forest, logistic regression), and derived several actionable insights for hotels to improve their business performance.
  - Deliverale: [Python Notebook](https://github.com/cwu821/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Python_Hotel_Cancelation_Analysis.ipynb).
  
- Retail Sales Forecast in R
  - Desctiption: This project used several time series models, such as ARIMA, Holt-Winters, and GARCH, on [U.S. retail sales data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RSCCAS) to model trend, seasonality, and volatility. The best model achieves an accuracy rate of 96%. As the retail sales of clothing can be closely related to peopleâ€™s purchasing power and economics background, we believe analyzing this series of clothing sales can be helpful in analyzing the economics market in general.
